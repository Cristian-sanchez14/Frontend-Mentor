        ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&#39;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I&#39;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

      <div class="bottom">
        ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I&#39;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ‚Äù
